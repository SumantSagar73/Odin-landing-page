# Web Page Design Project

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a web page based on a provided design. The objective was to replicate the design as closely as possible using HTML and CSS. The project focuses on translating visual design concepts into functional web pages, reinforcing skills in front-end development.

## Design Images

The design was provided in the form of two images:

1. **Full Design**: Shows the complete layout of the website, including the placement of various sections and elements.
2. **Color and Fonts**: Details the fonts and color scheme used in the design.

## Project Setup

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Created a new GitHub repository named `Odin-landing-project`.
   - Cloned the repository to the local machine and set up the project directory.

2. **HTML Structure**
   - Created the `index.html` file.
   - Structured the HTML according to the layout shown in the design images. The page includes four main sections and a footer.

3. **CSS Styling**
   - Created a `styles.css` file for styling.
   - Applied styles to match the designâ€™s fonts and color scheme. The design images were used as a reference for layout and spacing.

4. **Development Process**
   - Implemented one section at a time, starting from the top of the page.
   - Added content and structure first, then applied styling.
   - Utilized CSS properties such as `flexbox` to achieve the desired layout and alignment.

5. **Testing and Iteration**
   - Frequently reviewed the design images to ensure layout accuracy.
   - Made adjustments to HTML and CSS to improve alignment and styling.

6. **Deployment**
   - Ensured the main HTML file is named `index.html`.
   - Published the site using GitHub Pages by configuring the repository settings to deploy the `main` branch.


## Live View

You can view the live version of the project at [sumantsagar73.github.io/Odin-landing-page](https://sumantsagar73.github.io/Odin-landing-page). 

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Layout Precision**: Achieving exact alignment was challenging. I used flexible units and `flexbox` to handle layout and spacing.
- **Styling Details**: Some styling elements were new. I researched specific properties like rounded corners and font settings to ensure accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable practice in translating design concepts into HTML and CSS. By following the design images and making iterative adjustments, the final web page closely matches the intended design.
